# Single-Cycle_RISC-V_Processor
This repository holds files related to the development of a Single-Cycle RISC-V Processor developed by following the playlist "Processador RISC-V de Ciclo Ãšnico", that is made available by professor Rafael Lima at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKM6TRQ8YHKfz2YgbS8OvrcaEFIhxhEMJ. The project had changes so that instead of being executed in FPGA, both the execution and the analysis are done in simulation in the Quartus Prime Lite Edition, ModelSim software and EDA Playground. The activities were done in an incremental way, with the objective of building each piece of hardware separately in order to understand how each component works.
